# Production runbook

How a release reaches production, how to undo it, what each app needs to run, how production is watched, and how Compass reaches testers. It applies to Wave 7 (Section 19.2) and every release after it. The release checklist (`docs/release-checklist.md`) tracks whether each step has happened.

Related runbooks: `progressive-delivery.md` (rollout stages and flags), `backup-and-restore.md`, `incident-response.md`, `hosted-security-settings.md`. Self-hosters follow the docs site's Self-hosting guide; this runbook is for the GHXSTSHIP production deployment.

**Owner stop points** (Section 19.8) are marked **OWNER**. Stop there and ask; do not proceed on judgment.

## Environments

| Environment | Database                                                                      | Apps (Vercel team `ghxstship`)                                       | Edge Functions             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Local       | A Supabase CLI stack per checkout                                             | `next dev` / `next start`                                            | `supabase functions serve` |
| Staging     | Supabase project `xos-atlas-staging`                                          | Preview deployments of `atlas`, `gateway` and `docs` against staging | Staging project            |
| Production  | **OWNER** creates the production Supabase project (region, plan, PITR add-on) | Production deployments of `atlas`, `gateway` and `docs`              | Production project         |

The Vercel project `atlas` exists. **OWNER** creates `gateway` and `docs` (no cost on the current plan) and chooses the production domains; buying a domain is a stop point.

## Deploy order

Every release is a tag `vX.Y.Z` on `main`. Each step starts only when the one before it is green. Migrations go first because database changes follow expand and contract: no migration in a release breaks the build before it, so the old apps keep working while the new schema lands.

### 0. Preflight (release owner)

1. CI is green on the tagged commit: `checks`, `database`, `secrets`, `route-js-budget`, `visual`, `ai-evals`, `e2e`, `e2e-pseudo-locales`, `verapdf`, and `api-breaking-changes` (gate 20, `infra/ci/oasdiff.sh`) once the orchestrator adds it.
2. The release drill passed on the tagged commit: `infra/drills/release-drill.sh`. Attach the report to the release.
3. No High or Critical finding is open (`legal/security/findings`, `legal/accessibility/findings`, `legal/qa/findings`).
4. The status page shows the last 30 days inside the error budget (`incident-response.md`, After the incident).
5. Announce the window in the on-call channel and name the release owner and the incident commander for it.

### 1. Migrations

```sh
supabase link --project-ref <production-ref>
supabase migration list           # what production has, against the repository
supabase db push --dry-run        # the migrations that will run
supabase db push
```

- Run against staging first, then production, from the tagged commit.
- Never load `supabase/seeds` into production; they are the demo tenant.
- Then run `infra/drills/key-tables.sql` read-only in the production SQL editor and keep the output with the release.
- Database advisors: Dashboard, Advisors. Zero errors (gate 11).

### 2. Edge Functions

```sh
supabase functions deploy --project-ref <production-ref>
supabase secrets list --project-ref <production-ref>   # names only; values never print
```

Set any secret new in this release with `supabase secrets set --project-ref <production-ref> NAME=...` from the owner's secret store. Confirm the worker schedules (`webhook-dispatch`, `notification-dispatch`, `upload-scan`, `report-run`, each every minute) still exist: `select jobname, schedule from cron.job order by 1;`.

### 3. Apps

1. Vercel builds `atlas`, `gateway` and `docs` for the tagged commit as preview deployments against staging. Let Atlas and Gateway run there for 30 minutes with the synthetic checks green.
2. Promote to production. With Rolling Releases, the stages are 5, 25 and 100 percent, and the release gate (`progressive-delivery.md`) decides each step. Without them, promote and watch the gate's numbers for 30 minutes.
3. `docs` promotes directly; it is static.

### 4. Packages

Pushing the tag starts `publish-packages.yml` (`infra/ci/README.md`, section 5). It waits for the owner's approval in the `npm` and `pypi` environments. **OWNER** confirms the `@xos` npm scope and the `xos-sdk` PyPI name belong to the owner's accounts before the first publish; publishing under a new organization name is a stop point.

### 5. Compass

See Compass releases below. Compass ships on its own cadence; a web release never waits for store review.

### 6. Close

1. Smoke test as a real user: sign in to Atlas, open a project, open Gateway as an external party, call `GET /api/v1/openapi.json` and `xos auth status`.
2. Post the release notes and record the evidence in `docs/release-checklist.md`.

## Rollback

| A Compass build        | Expire the build in TestFlight, or halt the Play rollout; testers keep the previous build                                                                                  | Minutes         |

## Upload scanning (ClamAV)

Uploads are scanned by self-hosted ClamAV (owner decision 10, ADR 0033). Until clamd answers, every upload
stays quarantined: attachments cannot be downloaded, imports wait, and private uploads reach only their
uploader. Files never leave XOS infrastructure, so ClamAV is not a subprocessor.

**Run clamd**

- Image: `clamav/clamav:1.5.4` (pinned in ADR 0001). It is published for linux/amd64 only, so use an amd64
  host.
- Size: at least 2 vCPU and 4 GiB of memory. clamd holds the signature database in memory (about 1.5 GiB)
  and briefly needs twice that while it reloads after an update. Keep the signature volume on disk.
- Use the same settings as `infra/scanning/docker-compose.yaml`:
  - `CLAMD_CONF_StreamMaxLength=60M`, above the largest bucket limit of 50 MiB;
  - `CLAMD_CONF_MaxScanSize=150M` and `CLAMD_CONF_MaxFileSize=60M`;
  - a persistent volume at `/var/lib/clamav`;
  - the `clamdcheck.sh` health check.
- The image runs `freshclam` itself and updates signatures several times a day. Allow outbound HTTPS from
  the host to `database.clamav.net`. The first start downloads the database and takes a few minutes, and
  the health check stays red until it finishes.
- clamd has no authentication. Never expose port 3310 to the internet. The Edge Functions must reach it
  over a private network or an authenticated tunnel, for example WireGuard, Tailscale or a TLS tunnel
  that terminates on the clamd host. Allow only the tunnel's address on 3310.
- Run two instances behind a TCP load balancer if one host is a single point of failure you cannot
  accept. Scans are stateless.

**Connect the functions**

```sh
supabase secrets set --project-ref <production-ref> XOS_CLAMAV_HOST=<private address> XOS_CLAMAV_PORT=3310
```

Then call `upload-scan` once with the service key. A 200 with `"scanner": "clamav"` means it is connected.
A 503 `scanner-not-configured` means the secret is missing. The `retrying` outcome, with "clamd is
unreachable", means the network path is wrong. Leave `XOS_ENVIRONMENT=production` set: with it, the function
never falls back to the development pass-through, even if `SUPABASE_URL` looked local.

**Check it end to end on staging**

Upload the EICAR test file (eicar.org) as an attachment. After the next worker run it shows "Blocked",
the file is gone from storage, and clamd logs `Eicar-Test-Signature FOUND`. Upload an ordinary PDF: it
becomes downloadable after the next run.

**Alerts**

- `upload-scan` answering 503, or `retrying` and `failed` outcomes in its logs: clamd is missing or
  unreachable. Files are safe, because they stay quarantined, but nothing can be downloaded.
- Rows in `private.object_scans` or `attachment.scan` jobs in Scanning for more than 15 minutes.
- The clamd health check failing, or `freshclam` failing to update for more than 24 hours.

**Upgrade**

Renovate proposes new `clamav/clamav` tags. Update ADR 0001 and `infra/scanning/docker-compose.yaml`
together. Roll hosts one at a time; while one restarts, scans retry with backoff.

## On-call checklist

**At the start of a shift**

- [ ] The status page is green, and the last synthetics run is under 10 minutes old.
- [ ] No unresolved Sentry issue is marked for escalation; new issues since the last shift are triaged.

**Daily**

- [ ] Yesterday's errors in Sentry: each new issue has an owner or is resolved.
- [ ] The webhook, notification, upload-scan and report workers ran: `app.job_queue`, `app.webhook_deliveries` and `app.notification_deliveries` are not growing, no object waits in `private.object_scans` for more than a few minutes (`select bucket_id, count(*) from private.object_scans where scan_status = 'Scanning' group by 1;`), `upload-scan` answers 200 and not 503, and `cron.job_run_details` shows no failed database jobs.
- [ ] Database CPU, connections and disk are below 70 percent of the plan.

**Weekly**

- [ ] `backup-weekly.yml` succeeded and its artifact exists.
- [ ] Run `infra/drills/release-drill.sh` on a fresh local stack; record the result in `backup-and-restore.md`.
- [ ] Review Supabase advisors and `pnpm --filter @xos/config licenses:check`; dependency updates from Renovate are merged or triaged.
- [ ] Error budget: the 30-day uptime on the status page is above 99.9 percent.

**When paged**

Follow `incident-response.md`: confirm impact, set the severity, contain first, post on the status page within 30 minutes for SEV1 and SEV2, and page the Privacy Officer if personal data may be involved.

## Compass releases

Compass's version is in `apps/compass/app.json` (`4.0.0`); the bundle identifier and Android package are `pro.ghxstship.compass`.

### Prerequisites (OWNER)

1. An Apple Developer Program membership and an App Store Connect app record for `pro.ghxstship.compass`, with the App Group `group.pro.ghxstship.compass` and the Live Activity capability.
2. A Google Play Console developer account and an app for `pro.ghxstship.compass`, with Play App Signing on.
3. An Expo account for EAS Build and Submit, with `EXPO_TOKEN` stored as a secret if builds run in CI. EAS's free tier covers a few builds a month; more is a paid plan and a stop point.
4. App Store Connect API key and a Google Play service account for submission, stored in EAS (never in the repository).

### Build profiles

Add `apps/compass/eas.json` once the accounts exist:

```json
{
  "cli": { "version": ">= 25.0.0", "appVersionSource": "remote" },
  "build": {
    "production": {
      "environment": "production",
      "autoIncrement": true,
      "ios": { "resourceClass": "default" },
      "android": { "buildType": "app-bundle" }
    }
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {
      "ios": { "ascAppId": "<App Store Connect app id>" },
      "android": { "track": "internal", "releaseStatus": "draft" }
    }
  }
}
```

### TestFlight (iOS)

1. From the tagged commit: `cd apps/compass && eas build --platform ios --profile production`.
2. `eas submit --platform ios --profile production --latest` uploads the build to App Store Connect.
3. In App Store Connect, TestFlight: answer export compliance, add the build to the internal testing group (up to 100 team members; no review needed).
4. Testers install through the TestFlight app. Run the Maestro field flows on a tester device, including airplane mode and queue drain.
5. External TestFlight groups need Beta App Review. Adding one is fine; it is not a public release.

### Play internal testing (Android)

1. `eas build --platform android --profile production` (an `.aab`).
2. `eas submit --platform android --profile production --latest` uploads to the internal testing track as a draft.
3. In Play Console, Testing, Internal testing: add the tester list, review the release and roll it out to internal testers (up to 100; no review).
4. Testers join through the opt-in link and install from Play.

### OWNER stop: public store submission

Submitting to the public App Store (App Review for release) or promoting to the Play production track (or closed and open tracks that reach the public) is a Section 19.8 stop condition. The release owner prepares the listing, screenshots, privacy labels (App Privacy and the Play Data safety form, from `legal/`), age rating and review notes with a demo account, then stops and asks the owner. Only the owner presses Submit for Review or promotes to production.
